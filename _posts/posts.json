        "content": "<p>They say that breakfast is the most important meal of the day. And while your stomach may not agree, its at least advisable to have something before you start a long hard work day. You can arguably make it more pleasant by creating a little area in your kitchen or living room, where you can read your morning news, check email, or simply watch as your neighborhood awakens and prepares for the day ahead. Some of these breakfast nook ideas can dispose even the most earnest owls to at least crack a smile at their sight.</p> <h4>Bright Breakfast Nook Ideas</h4> <p>Bright colors are energizing. And if you dont drink coffee, you might need something else to perk you up after (hopefully) hours of sleep. There are many ways you can use brights to both take advantage of that quality but also lessen their characteristic eye-watering effect. A bold bright settee or bench is a great way to focus all attention on the area, while a few bright throw pillows make for eye-catchy accents.</p> <h4>Minimal Breakfast Nook Designs</h4> <p>Not a fan of loud sounds or colors in the morning? We hear ya. Minimalism does well not only in terms of style but also creates a calm atmosphere, where you can come to your senses at the pace, youre most comfortable with. Milky greys, browns, and grey-ish blues are perfect hues for setting a mild tone to your breakfast area.</p>",

        "content": "<p>The rivalry between cats and dogs is one thats known around the world. Its depicted time after time in cartoons and films and youve probably heard of the saying they fight like cats and dogs. Many believe that the two species cant get along and that its just a simple case of them being too different from one another, as dogs are exuberant and full of energy, while cats are solitary creatures that prefer peace and quiet. But whats the actual reason behind the clash and most importantly, can they ever get along? Keep reading to find out about the possibility of cat and dog friends and discover the reasoning behind why their personalities usually clash.</p> <h4>Mixed messages</h4> <p>Where its sometimes the case of opposites attract, this doesnt seem to be the case with cats and dogs. The main thing getting in the way of a harmonious friendship is that cat and dog body language often means different things.</p> <p>With a dog a high tail and head means that theyre challenging the other individual, while in cats this is often a signal that they want to be friends. A wagging tail also means the opposite thing in the two species, as the swishing back and forth of a tail can indicate a happy and excitable dog, but a very angry cat.</p> <p>Because their body language is so different, they often misinterpret each other which results in plenty of scratched noses and frightened and confused cats and dogs. However, this doesnt mean that theyre incompatible by nature, they just need careful introductions in an environment where they can get used to each others differences. So, how do help make your cat and dog become friends with each other?</p> <h4>First impressions are vital</h4> <p>The trick to making your cat and dog friends is to start with the right introductions. Cats are quite unforgiving in their nature and are less likely to be open to the situation if it goes badly, so its very important that the first encounter goes well. Take your time with the introductions and let them sniff each other before meeting face-to-face by using their bedding or something else that they frequently use. This will allow them to familiarise themselves and get used to each other a little at a time, and will make the first meeting less stressful for both of them.</p> <h4>Its easier when theyre young</h4> <p>Cats and dogs are much more likely to become lifelong friends if they meet each other from the very start, as theyll be able to grow up together and learn how the other wants them to behave as theyre still discovering the world around them. When theyre young theyre more likely to be open to a friendship as territorial behaviours and the traditional fear instincts have not yet been given time to manifest.</p>",

        "content": "<h4>Does a healthy lifestyle make a difference?</h4> <p>As it turns out, healthy habits make a big difference. According to this analysis, people who met criteria for all five habits enjoyed significantly, impressively longer lives than those who had none: 14 years for women and 12 years for men (if they had these habits at age 50). People who had none of these habits were far more likely to die prematurely from cancer or cardiovascular disease.</p> <p>Study investigators also calculated life expectancy by how many of these five healthy habits people had. Just one healthy habit (and it didnt matter which one) … just one… extended life expectancy by two years in men and women. Not surprisingly, the more healthy habits people had, the longer their lifespan. This is one of those situations where I wish I could reprint their graphs for you, because theyre so cool. (But if youre very curious, the article is available online, and the graphs are on page 7. Check out Graph B, 'Estimated life expectancy at age 50 according to the number of low-risk factors.')</p> <p>This is huge. And, it confirms prior similar research — a lot of prior similar research. A 2017 study using data from the Health and Retirement Study found that people 50 and older who were normal weight, had never smoked, and drank alcohol in moderation lived on average seven years longer. A 2012 mega-analysis of 15 international studies that included over 500,000 participants found that over half of premature deaths were due to unhealthy lifestyle factors such as poor diet, inactivity, obesity, excessive alcohol intake, and smoking. And the list of supporting research goes on.</p>",
